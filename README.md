# React Tic-Tac-Toe

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using React. It follows the official React documentation tutorial for building a Tic-Tac-Toe game.

## Getting Started

To run the project, make sure you have Node.js installed. Then, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd tictactoe
npm install
```

## Running the Application

npm run dev
```

Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the Tic-Tac-Toe game in action.
